# Why?
This was a technical test for a job I applied for. I was given the task to make a page for a hypothetical band named Moosic that had a working JavaScript player that could dynamically count the total amount of tracks and total album time as well as have a volume slider and play/pause functionality. They also wanted a contact form implemented.

I bought a cow costume and inflatable cow, took a bunch of lame pictures, and wrote a parody of the song "Happy Together" and changed the lyrics to "Together Forever" as that was one of the track names on the hypothetical band's new album. I also recorded a music video and the piano and drum tracks for the parody. I had a friend of mine record the vocal track and mix/master it for me and ended up landing the job with the whole mess you see now!
